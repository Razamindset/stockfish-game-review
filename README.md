# Chess Game Review Engine

To Start the development, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Stockfish website at https://stockfishchess.org/download/.
2. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and download the file.
3. Once downloaded, rename the file to `stockfish.exe`.
4. Move the renamed file into the `engine` folder of your project.

You can run Stockfish simply by executing the command in your terminal:

```bash
 python src/main.py
```

We have multiple 2 implentations for now one is the multi threaded and one is the single threaded version.

Run by

```bash
python src\single_py_thread.py
```

or

```bash
python src\multi_py_thread.py
```

This will start the Stockfish engine and you can begin using it for your chess applications.
